For a given array of transactions, group all the transaction by item name, return an array of string
where each string contains the item name followed by a SPACE and the number of associated
transactions, then sort the array in descending order by transaction count, then ascending 
alphabetically by item name for items with matching transaction counts.


For Example :

Transaction = ['purse', 'purse', 'belt', 'jeans', 'jeans']

There are 2 items with 2 transaction each : 'purse' and 'jeans' 
     Alphabetical order for above TXN is 'jeans' and 'purse'
AND
There is 1 item with 1 transaction : 'belt'

The required output is : ['jeans 2', 'purse 2', 'belt 1']
